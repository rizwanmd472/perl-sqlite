REQUIRED TECHNOLOGIES : 

PERL
SQL (can be any type of SQL)

Project two : Perl / Database

You will write a Perl script to output the contents of a table in a database.

1) Create a database (SQLite) containing one table with data. You must have at least three columns.  (You can use the data from project one.)

2) Using the DBI Perl module, write a perl script that connects to a database.

3) The script selects the contents of the table you created.

4) Finally the script prints out the contents of the table.

We are looking for a syntactically correct perl script.

Helpful Hint:

SQLite was chosen for portability, your script should be able to run anywhere. (https://www.sqlite.org/)

Execution:

-------install Sqlite and Active perl

------type perl select.pl in cmd for windows
